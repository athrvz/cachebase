What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Data Structures: Redis supports advanced data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets. Cachebase currently only supports simple key-value pairs.

Persistence: Redis can persist data to disk (RDB snapshots and AOF logs). Cachebase is purely in-memory and loses data on restart.

Replication: Redis supports master-slave replication for high availability. Cachebase has no replication mechanism.

Clustering: Redis supports distributed clustering for horizontal scaling. Cachebase is a single-node service.

Pub/Sub: Redis has a publish/subscribe messaging system. Cachebase lacks this feature.

Lua Scripting: Redis allows users to run Lua scripts on the server. Cachebase has no scripting support.

Transactions: Redis supports atomic transactions with MULTI/EXEC. Cachebase has no transaction support.

Eviction Policies: Redis supports various eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) when memory is full. Cachebase has no eviction mechanism.

2. Performance
What Cachebase Has:
Basic in-memory storage with a map[string]Record data structure.

gRPC for communication, which is efficient but not as lightweight as Redis’s custom protocol.

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Optimized Data Structures: Redis uses highly optimized data structures (e.g., hash tables, skip lists) for performance.

Single-Threaded Architecture: Redis uses a single-threaded event loop, which avoids contention and is highly efficient for I/O-bound workloads.

Custom Protocol: Redis uses a custom binary protocol (RESP) that is lightweight and fast.

Pipelining: Redis supports pipelining to batch multiple commands and reduce round-trip time. Cachebase does not support this.

3. Scalability
What Cachebase Has:
Single-node architecture with no support for scaling.

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Clustering: Redis supports distributed clustering with automatic sharding and failover.

Replication: Redis supports master-slave replication for read scalability and high availability.

Partitioning: Redis can partition data across multiple nodes using consistent hashing.

4. Durability and Fault Tolerance
What Cachebase Has:
No persistence or fault tolerance. Data is lost if the service crashes or restarts.

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Persistence: Redis supports RDB snapshots and AOF (Append-Only File) for durability.

Replication: Redis replicates data to slave nodes for fault tolerance.

Failover: Redis Sentinel provides automatic failover in case of master node failure.

5. Ease of Use and Ecosystem
What Cachebase Has:
Basic gRPC API for communication.

No client libraries or tools (other than the Go client we built).

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Rich Client Libraries: Redis has client libraries for almost every programming language.

CLI Tools: Redis provides a command-line interface (redis-cli) for interacting with the server.

Monitoring and Metrics: Redis provides tools like redis-benchmark and redis-stat for monitoring and performance testing.

Community and Documentation: Redis has a large community and extensive documentation.

6. Security
What Cachebase Has:
No built-in security features (e.g., authentication, encryption).

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Authentication: Redis supports password-based authentication.

TLS Encryption: Redis supports encrypted connections using TLS.

ACLs: Redis 6 introduced Access Control Lists (ACLs) for fine-grained permissions.

7. Monitoring and Maintenance
What Cachebase Has:
No built-in monitoring or maintenance tools.

What Redis Has (and Cachebase Lacks):
Metrics: Redis provides detailed metrics (e.g., memory usage, command statistics).

Slow Log: Redis logs slow queries for performance analysis.

Background Tasks: Redis performs background tasks like key eviction and AOF rewriting.
