Okay, we want to implement RDB optimization. In Redis, RDB snapshots can be performed in the background using fork(), but since Go doesn't support forking, I need another way to do background saving without blocking the main process.

First, the current RDB saving might block writes if it takes too long. To optimize, I should separate the saving process into a background goroutine. But how to create a consistent snapshot without blocking the main data store?

Maybe use a copy-on-write approach. But Go doesn't have fork, so I need to manually create a copy of the data. However, for large datasets, this could be memory intensive. Alternatively, maybe use a read lock and serialize while allowing writes to proceed, but that might lead to inconsistent snapshots.

Wait, in the current code, the SaveRDB function uses a read lock (mu.RLock()) while encoding. That allows reads to continue but blocks on writes. But if the dataset is large, serializing could take time, causing writes to be delayed. To optimize, perhaps create a point-in-time snapshot by cloning the data store under a write lock, then serialize the clone in the background without holding the lock.

So the steps would be:

1. Acquire a read lock to prevent writes while cloning.

2. Clone the Cache map.

3. Release the lock.

4. Serialize the cloned map to disk in the background.

But cloning a large map could be expensive. Alternatively, maybe use a more efficient serialization method or incremental saving.

Alternatively, use a background goroutine that periodically triggers the save, but ensure that during the save, the data is consistent. The current implementation uses a read lock during serialization, which is okay but might not be optimal. To optimize, maybe use a copy of the data to avoid holding the lock for the entire serialization.

Wait, we can have Redis-like configuration. Redis uses fork() to create a child process that writes the RDB while the parent continues handling commands. Since Go can't fork, the alternative is to create a snapshot of the data and serialize it in the background.

So here's the plan:

- When triggering an RDB save, create a deep copy of the Cache.

- Serialize the copy in a background goroutine.

- This way, the main process isn't blocked during serialization.

But deep copying a map in Go isn't straightforward. For the Cache, which is a map[string]storage.Record, a shallow copy won't work if the Record contains pointers. But in the current setup, the Record's Value is an interface{}, which could be a value type. So a deep copy might be necessary.

Alternatively, during the RDB save, hold the read lock just long enough to create a copy, then release the lock and serialize the copy. This minimizes the time the lock is held.

Let me adjust the SaveRDB function:

1. Acquire a read lock.

2. Create a copy of Cache.

3. Release the read lock.

4. Serialize the copied data in the background.

This way, the main process can continue handling writes after the copy is made, and the serialization happens on the copied data without blocking.

# Additional RDB Optimizations

But this approach requires that the snapshot is a full copy, which could be memory intensive for large datasets. However, it allows the main process to continue without blocking during serialization.

Another optimization is to compress the RDB file. Using gzip or another compression algorithm during serialization.

Also, handle errors properly in the background goroutine, perhaps logging them.

Additionally, track ongoing background saves to prevent multiple concurrent saves, which could waste resources.

So, adding a state variable to track if a save is in progress, and if so, skip initiating a new one until the current completes.

But need to manage this state safely with atomic operations or mutexes.

Putting it all together:

- When a save is triggered (either by schedule or manually), check if a save is already in progress.
- If not, create a snapshot of dataStore under a read lock.
- Spawn a goroutine to handle the serialization of the snapshot.
- Update the state to indicate a save is in progress, and reset it once done.

This would prevent multiple background saves from running concurrently, which could be problematic.

Also, in the configuration, allow disabling background saving if needed, though the default would be background.

Another consideration: During the snapshot creation, if a write occurs after the snapshot is made, the RDB file won't reflect those changes, which is acceptable as it's a point-in-time snapshot.

Testing this approach with a large dataset to ensure it doesn't cause memory spikes.

So, updating the RDB code to use snapshotting in the background, thus optimizing the main process's responsiveness.

# Optimization Strategy
1. Snapshot isolation: Create a point-in-time copy of cache (data store) to avoid writes
2. Background serializaiton: Write snapshots to disk in goroutines
3. Resource Management: Limit concurrent save and add compression
